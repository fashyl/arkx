# Wireless Channels
## 2,4GHz
For wireless networks that operate on 2,4GHz. What we really mean is that **they operate on roughly the band from 2.4 gigahertz to 2.5 gigahertz** between these two frequencies are a number of channels, each with a width of a certain megahertz.

The point is to understand how collision domains are a necessary problem with all wireless networks and how you can use your knowledge in this space to optimize wireless network deployments.

You want to make sure that both your own access points and those of neighboring businesses overlap channels as little as possible.

**For an 802.11 B network this means that channels 1 and 6 and 11 are the only ones that never overlap at all.**
