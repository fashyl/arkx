# Definition
>[!quote] Good analogy
>" You can think of scope like the view of the night sky from your [window](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/window). Everyone who lives on the planet Earth is in the global scope of the stars. The stars are accessible _globally_. Meanwhile, if you live in a city, you may see the city skyline or the river. The skyline and river are only accessible _locally_ in your city, but you can still see the stars that are available globally "  - source : [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)
