##  Extended React Challenge: Incorporating Conditional Rendering and Props

**Objective**

Building upon the basic challenge of creating a landing page for a blog application, this extended challenge introduces the concepts of **conditional rendering** and **using props** in React. You will enhance your blog landing page with dynamic content based on props and conditions.

**Challenge Steps**

1.  **Introducing Props to Components**
    
    -   **Modify the Header Component**: Add props to the `Header` component to accept a blog title and links for the navigation bar dynamically. Use these props within the component to render the title and navigation links.
        
    -   **Enhance the MainContent Component**: Update the `MainContent` component to accept a prop named `posts` that contains an array of blog post summaries (e.g., title and a short description). Use this prop to dynamically render a list of posts.
        
    
2.  **Implementing Conditional Rendering**
    
    -   **Conditional Rendering in MainContent**: Modify the `MainContent` component to display a message such as "No posts available" when the `posts` array is empty. This introduces conditional rendering based on the length of the `posts` array.
        
    -   **Create a Login Button**: In the `Header` component, add a button for logging in. This button will not perform an actual login but will demonstrate conditional rendering. Use a prop to manage the login state (`isLoggedIn`), and conditionally render the button text to show "Login" or "Logout" based on the `isLoggedIn` prop's value.
        
    
3.  **Adding Dynamic Styles with Props**
    
    -   **Styling Based on Props**: In any component of your choice, implement dynamic styling based on props. For example, you could change the background color of the header based on a prop. This demonstrates how props can not only control content but also styles dynamically.
        
    
4.  **Assemble and Pass Props in the App Component**
    
    -   In `index.js`, prepare sample data for your props (e.g., a blog title, navigation links, and an array of post summaries).
        
    -   Pass these props to your components in the App component's return statement.
        
    -   Implement conditional rendering logic in your components based on the passed props.
        
    
5.  **Test Your Application**
    
    -   Test different scenarios by modifying the props in `index.js`, such as changing the blog title, adding/removing posts, and toggling the login state.
        
    -   Ensure your conditional rendering logic correctly displays content based on these props.
        
    

**Additional Requirements**

-   Include detailed comments explaining your conditional rendering logic and how you are using props in your components.
    
-   Ensure your code is well-organized and readable, with proper indentation and naming conventions.
    

**Submission Guidelines**

-   Update your GitHub repository with the new code enhancements.
    
-   Provide a brief description in your submission detailing the changes and additions you made to incorporate conditional rendering and props.
    

This extended challenge aims to deepen your understanding of React's powerful features, such as props and conditional rendering. By completing this challenge, you will be better equipped to build dynamic and interactive web applications with React. Good luck!
