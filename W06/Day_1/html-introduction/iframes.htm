    <!-- Frames were introduced in HTML for creating multiple sections or "frames" within a single web page. 
        Each frame could load a different HTML document,
        essentially dividing the browser window 
        into multiple independent sections. -->

    <!-- "inline frames," provide a more modern and flexible way to embed content from another source within a web page.
         They create a self-contained frame within the current document, 
         allowing you to display external content seamlessly. -->

    <!-- An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document. -->
    <!-- used for ads and in malicious sites -->
