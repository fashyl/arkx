## Detailed Tasks
- **Navbar and Footer**: Make sure these are consistent on every page and link to the appropriate sections. The navbar should be created using the <nav> element, and the footer should use the <footer> element.
- **Page Structure**: Each page should be appropriately titled using the <title> tag within the <head>, and the content should be wrapped in semantic HTML5 tags such as <header>, <main>, <section>, <article>, and <aside>.
- **Accessibility**: All interactive elements must have proper accessibility attributes, such as alt text for images and aria-labels for form inputs and buttons.
- **Comments**: Use HTML comments to label each section of the page, which will help organize the structure and make it easier for review.
## Additional Notes
At this stage, focus on the HTML structure only. Styling with CSS and interactivity with JavaScript will be introduced in the following days.
The filter or search functionality on the movies page and the form functionality on the contact page will be non-functional HTML placeholders until later challenges.
