# Sort & Search
## Introduction 
Greetings, coders! Welcome to the Sorting and Searching Challenge. In this task, you will be tasked with implementing key sorting and searching algorithms. Your mission is to conquer the realms of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Linear Search, and Binary Search. Precision and efficiency will be your allies in this coding expedition.
## Challenge Overview
Giving an array of numbers write the following algorithms in Javascript : 
### Sorting algorithms
- Bubble Sort : Implement a basic yet fundamental sorting algorithm.
- Selection Sort : Develop a sorting algorithm by strategically selecting and arranging elements.
- Insertion Sort : Create an algorithm that constructs a sorted array incrementally.
### Searching algorithms
- Linear Search : Implement the basic search algorithm to find a specific element.
- Binary Search : Develop an advanced search algorithm suitable for sorted arrays.
## Guidelines 
- Separate functions for each algorithm.
Each sorting function should accept a single parameter representing the array of numbers to be sorted, and return the sorted array.
- Each search function should accept two parameters : an array of numbers, and the number to look for in the array. Then, if found, return the index of the first occurrence of the element. Otherwise return null.
- For binary search we assume that the numbers are sorted in ascending order.
- Sorting algorithms should sort in ascending order.
- Employ clear variable names and comments.
- Thoroughly test your implementations with diverse inputs.
- Optimize your code to showcase algorithmic efficiency.
