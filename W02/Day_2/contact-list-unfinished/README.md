## Build a Contact List
Build a Node.js application that allows users to store and retrieve contacts. Each contact should have a name and a phone number. The application should provide the following functionalities:
- Add a contact: Prompt the user to enter a name and phone number, then store it in a collection (e.g., an array or object).
- View all contacts: Display a list of all the stored contacts, showing both the name and phone number.
- Search for a contact: Prompt the user to enter a name and search for the contact in the collection. If found, display the name and phone number. If not found, display a message indicating that the contact was not found.
- Exit the application: Allow the user to exit the application gracefully.

Reuse and extend the code from the 'Node.js Readline module' example.
