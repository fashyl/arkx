## Random City Temperature Display with File Operations
In this challenge, we will build upon the previous "Random City Temperature Display" exercise and introduce file operations. The goal is to read the city name from a file named "input.txt," retrieve the weather data for the chosen city, and write the temperature result into a file with the city name as "cityname.txt". Before writing the result, you should delete any existing file for the chosen city.
### Requirements
- Read the city name from the "input.txt" file.
- Retrieve the weather data for the chosen city.
- Delete any existing file for the chosen city.
- Write the temperature result into a new file named "cityname.txt".

    Handle any errors that may occur during file operations, API requests, or other steps.
