## Authentication using Passport.js and Discord OAuth2

### Overview:
This implementation demonstrates how to set up authentication in a Node.js application using Passport.js with Discord OAuth2 strategy. Discord OAuth2 allows users to log in to your application using their Discord accounts.

### Setup:
1. Install necessary packages:
   ```bash
   npm install express passport passport-discord express-session ejs
   ```

2. Create a Discord application:
   - Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
   - Create a new application.
   - Navigate to the "OAuth2" section.
   - Add `http://localhost:PORT/auth/discord/callback` as a Redirect URI (modify as per your setup).
   - Copy the Client ID and Client Secret for later use.

3. Set up Passport.js:
   - Require necessary modules and set up Express and Passport.js in your application.
   - Configure Discord OAuth2 strategy in Passport.js.
   - Initialize Passport.js and set up session middleware.

4. Define routes:
   - Create routes for handling authentication:
     - `/auth/discord` for initiating OAuth2 authentication.
     - `/auth/discord/callback` for handling the OAuth2 callback.
     - `/logout` for logging out the user.

5. Implement authentication logic:
   - Define authentication middleware to protect routes that require authentication.
   - Handle OAuth2 callback to exchange code for access token and user profile.
   - Serialize and deserialize user objects to manage user sessions.

6. Integrate with your application:
   - Integrate authentication into your application routes as required.
   - Utilize user session data as needed to personalize user experience.

### Usage:
1. Start your Node.js application:
   ```bash
   nodemon
   ```

2. Navigate to `http://localhost:PORT` in your browser to access your application.
   
3. Click on the "Login with Discord" button to initiate OAuth2 authentication with Discord.

### Note:
- Ensure you keep your Client ID and Client Secret secure.
- Customize routes, views, and authentication logic as per your application's requirements.
- This is a basic implementation. Additional features like error handling, user roles, etc., can be added based on your needs.
